# Anonymization and Pseudonymization of CSV Data

This webapp was developed as part of the "Forschungsseminar" in Web Engineering at the [Distributed and Self-organizing Systems](https://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/) faculty at Technical University Chemnitz in the Wintersemester 2022/2023.

It allows users to upload a CSV file and display its data in a table. The user can pseudonymize/anonymize certain columns using the dropdown menus next to each column header, and then export the pseudonymized/anonymized data as a CSV file.

This webapp was built using ReactJS and Bootstrap 5. It makes use of the latest web technologies to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. A [live demo](https://fb158c81.anon-pseu-demo.pages.dev/) is available on our Cloudflare page, where you can try out the webapp and see how it works.
